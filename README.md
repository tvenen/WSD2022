In this repo is our project titled, "Turning 50-50s into an Advantage: Characterizing How Neaby Players Affect Duels." 

Repo Explanation:
'by_country_maxmin' and 'by_match_maxmin' are the CSV files that have all the data that was analyzed for results.
'by_match_stats.csv', 'development_code.RMD', 'Goal_stats.py', and 'extradata_by_country' are development files that were used to make the final spreadsheets. To run the scripts, 
'data_analysis.RMD' and 'results.pdf' are the final presentable results and code.
